== Contentator

Contentator is designed to be a flexible, light cms.  Hopefully it won't get in your way and will give you an easy way to add inline content editing and navigation   management.

== Install

    gem install contentator

== Usage

Create a new rails app with the contentator template

     rails MY_APP -m YOUR_GEM_PATH/lib/template.rb
     
Then drop in a database.yml and fire up the database

    rake db:create:all
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:test:prepare
    
Start the server and begin adding content.  Go to /admin and begin adding pages.  

== Custom Content

There is a generator for custom cms content types.  It works much like a nested resource and creates inline editing.

    script/generate content contact name:string email:string phone:string notes:text
    
The new content type will need to be wired up.  To create a contacts template just make a new template in the page model, add an admin tool in views/cms/admin/_admin_toolbar.html.haml and create a view in views/cms/content.

== Globalization

The admin text all translatable.  The english version is located in config/locales/en.yml.  There is also a sample de.yml file for testing locales.  Just add a new locale file to add other langauge support.

The globalization2 plugin is also installed.  Dynamic content in pages and page content blocks can accept translations for any locale.

There is support for using locale subdomains already.  See set_locale in the application controller. Add the following to /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1       en.localhost
    127.0.0.1       de.localhost
    
The locale will automatically be set based on the subdomain.
